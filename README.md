## Automated Seizure Recognition and Prediction Using Ordinal Patterns in EEG.
* Objective: Developed a cutting-edge method for automatic seizure recognition and prediction.
* Data Preprocessing: Handled raw EEG data preprocessing, ensuring clean and usable data for analysis.
* Segmentation: Performed sequential segmentation of EEG data to isolate relevant signal patterns.
* Feature Selection: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select the most significant features, enhancing the model's efficiency and accuracy.
* Classification: Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure events.
* Outcome: Achieved an exceptional classification accuracy of 100%, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach.

## Epileptic Seizure Detection System Using K-means Clustering on EEG Data.
* Objective: Created a system to identify epileptic seizures using machine learning techniques.
* Data Standardization: Standardized raw EEG data to ensure consistency across samples, facilitating more reliable analysis.
* Clustering Algorithm: Utilized K-means clustering to group EEG data into seizure and non-seizure categories.
* Classification: Further classified the standardized EEG data, leveraging the K-means clustering algorithm for pattern recognition.
* Outcome: Attained a high classification accuracy of 98.84%, validating the system's capability in detecting epileptic seizures effectively.
